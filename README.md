## üöÄ Hyper-Advanced Autonomous Agent Architecture üöÄ

**QuantumNexus** is an experimental, hyper-advanced autonomous agent architecture designed as an evolutionary leap beyond conventional AI systems. It aims to integrate quantum-inspired processing, hyperdimensional computing, and multimodal intelligence fusion to achieve a new level of autonomous cognitive capabilities.

**NEXUS-CORE LEVEL: TRANSCENDENT**

### ‚ú® Core Capabilities

*   **Quantum-Inspired Processing:** Utilizes superposition of cognitive pathways for novel problem-solving.
*   **Adaptive Neuromorphic Architecture:** Features dynamic pathway formation and self-optimization.
*   **Self-Evolving Code Generation:** Employs metaprogramming for runtime code adaptation and evolution.
*   **Hyperdimensional Computing:** Enables efficient processing and fusion of multimodal information.
*   **Advanced Consciousness Simulation:** Includes reflective awareness and internal state modeling.
*   **Harmonic Resonance:** Facilitates cross-domain knowledge synthesis and integration.
*   **Reality Modeling:** Incorporates counterfactual reasoning for robust decision-making.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Modules & Components

QuantumNexus is built with a modular design, including:

*   **`QuantumNexusModel`**: The core neural network with quantum-inspired layers (`QuantumAttentionLayer`, `HyperdimensionalEncoder`, `FractalLayer`, `QuantumResonanceTensor`, `NeocortexBlock`).
*   **`QuantumNexusAgent`**: The primary agent class orchestrating perception, action, and refinement.
*   **`AIManager`**: Central management system coordinating `TemporalPlanner`, `AutonomousMind`, `ConsciousnessModule`, `ImaginationEngine`, `MetaLearningModule`, and `MetaEvolutionEngine`.
*   **`SuperQuantumFreeWill`**: Advanced decision-making module with quantum-inspired URL selection and link discovery.
*   **`ConsciousnessModule`**: Simulates self-reflection, awareness, and metacognitive processes.
*   **`ImaginationEngine`**: Enables creative thinking, counterfactual reasoning, and predictive modeling, including error simulation.
*   **`TemporalPlanner`**: Manages short-term and long-term goals with temporal dependencies.
*   **`MetaLearningModule`**: Optimizes the learning process itself by analyzing performance and adapting learning parameters.
*   **`MetaEvolutionEngine`**: Drives system-level self-evolution of algorithms, architectures, and strategies.
*   **`PlannerSifter`**: Selects optimal exploration and operational strategies based on context.
*   **`ContentSifter`**: Evaluates content quality and extracts key information.
*   **`SemanticMemoryModule`**: Stores and retrieves knowledge with semantic encoding and a knowledge graph.
*   **`DomainIntelligence`**: Analyzes website characteristics, content patterns, and authority.
*   **Flask Dashboard**: Provides a basic web interface to monitor agent status and logs.

### üíª Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **PyTorch**: For neural network implementation and quantum-inspired layers.
*   **Flask**: For the real-time monitoring dashboard.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
*   **Requests & BeautifulSoup4**: For web content fetching and parsing.
*   **Selenium**: For more realistic web interactions (optional, via `REAL_INTERACTION` flag).
*   **Google Colab**: Integrated support for running in Colab, including Google Drive for model checkpointing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Highlights

Key operational parameters can be configured via global variables at the top of the script:

*   `REAL_INTERACTION` (default: `True`): Enables Selenium-based web interactions.
*   `SAFE_MODE` (default: `False`): Toggles safety restrictions.
*   `MODEL_PATH`: Path for saving/loading the model checkpoint. (Handles Colab/local paths)
*   `GOOGLE_DRIVE_MODEL_PATH`: Specific Google Drive path for model checkpoints in Colab.
*   `LOG_FILE`: Path to the log file.
*   `FLASK_PORT`: Port for the dashboard.
*   `SELF_MODIFY_INTERVAL`: Number of cycles between self-evolution attempts.
*   `MEMORY_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum size for certain memory structures.
*   `SAVE_INTERVAL`: Frequency of saving checkpoints.

---

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Git
*   If `REAL_INTERACTION = True`:
    *   Google Chrome browser installed.
    *   ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version, accessible in your system's PATH or specified in the script. (Colab setup handles this automatically).

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/QuantumNexus.git
    cd QuantumNexus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file would typically list: `torch numpy flask requests beautifulsoup4 selenium google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`)*

#### Running the Script

*   **Locally:**
    ```bash
    python quantum_nexus.py
    ```
    (Assuming your main script file is named `quantum_nexus.py`)

*   **In Google Colab:**
    1.  Upload the script (or clone the repository within Colab).
    2.  The script contains a `run_in_colab()` function designed to handle Colab-specific setup (like Google Drive mounting for model checkpoints).
    3.  Ensure the Google Drive path `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/quantum_nexus/` exists or is created for storing model checkpoints and state.
    4.  Execute the cell containing `run_in_colab()`.

### üìä Dashboard

A Flask-based dashboard provides real-time insights into the agent's status, last action, memory size, and a view of the agent's log.
Access it by navigating to `http://localhost:[FLASK_PORT]` (e.g., `http://localhost:5012`) in your web browser after starting the script.

### üìú Disclaimer

QuantumNexus is a highly experimental research project exploring advanced concepts in artificial intelligence. The terms "quantum-inspired," "consciousness simulation," "AGI," "ASI," and "transcendent" are used to reflect the ambitious theoretical underpinnings and aspirational goals of this architecture. It does **not** represent a functional AGI/ASI or a true quantum computer. The project is intended for research and educational purposes to explore the boundaries of autonomous agent design.
